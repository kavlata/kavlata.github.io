## My Space

The site is available at - https://kavlata.github.io/. It has been hosted using Github pages.

I will be using this space to give credits to people who I follow for learning!

* Thanks to Nikhita. I made this blog with the help of her tutorial. [How to build a blog using Github, Jekyll and Lanyon](https://nikhita.github.io/build-blog-using-github-jekyll)
