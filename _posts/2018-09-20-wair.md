## What Am I Reading .. Today

### 20th September
 [An beginners article on how to read research papers and to follow the topic in general.](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-reading-deep-learning-research-papers-the-why-and-the-how-dfd1ac15dbc0)

Couple of takeaways from this article were
1. [Arxiv Sanity](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com)
2. [Thread on subReddit. This was my source of inspiration for today's blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/807ex4/d_machine_learning_wayr_what_are_you_reading_week/)

### Last week
I wanted to try some of the resources mentioned in [this article from kdnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/02/5-fantastic-practical-natural-language-processing-resources.html)
I must say the videos from Dr.Jon Krohn were absolutely wonderful. 
1. They start with basic details without the need for a lot of pre-requisites.
2. The transition through 3 part videos series is very fluid. Deep learning to Natural language processing and 
then to the more sophisticated GANs and Re-inforcement Learning. 
If you can't access the videos, then jupyter notebook compilations are very useful as well. 
I am eagerly awaiting his book which is going to come out in December this year.
