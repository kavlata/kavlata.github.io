title: My NLP Curriculum
description: I created a curriculum for myself to learn
comments: true

Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning are the new buzz words recently. 

There are lot of MOOCs and online courses / certifications available for these topics as well. I have always worked on Text and wanted to 
enroll in such course with Natural Language Processing in focus. Having gone through the syllabus and contens of few courses online, I felt
the need to create a curriculum of my own. This is because the online material available is all disperse and I ended up going away from
the course to gather my knowledge. So this is my attempt in educating / updating my NLP knowledge. Feel free to use this and modify it to 
your needs.

Major Topics that I need to work on:
1. Programming - Python, PyTorch
2. Math - Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics
3. NLP - Linguistics, Statistical NLP, Deep NLP
4. Data Science - Pandas
5. MOOC - Andrew Ng, Stanford NLP, Oxford Deep Mind Lectures
Reference - Jason Brownlee, Dan Jurafsky Speech & Language Processing book, Cracking the coding interview

I am going to give myself about 8 months to finish my own curriculum and the test is I come up with my own Project implementation of 
something interesting in NLP using Deep learning (more like a thesis if possible). I will grade myself and I must say I am my worst critic.
So trust me, this is a difficult assignment!

I will be updating this list as and when I find something new to add to the list.

1. Python:
   1. Generators 
   1. Vectorization
   1. Data Structures
      1. Numpy structures and their implementation
