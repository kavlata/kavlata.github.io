I am so excited to share that I have been accepted to the LxMLS 2021 - Lisbon Machine learning School. I received their email today and have been in cloud 9 since. 
I have been following this summer school and few more since 5 years now. Finally I got an opportunity to attend. Considering this is during the pandemic time, it works 
well for me, since I get to attend it virtually and still be able to take care of my son and family. For someone like me who is a full time working mom, opportunities 
like these are rare and blessing in disguise. I cant thank the LxMLS folks to have accepted my application. They had asked a few questions related to my interests in NLP.
NLP is all that I have worked in last few years, writing this application wasn't very difficult because, it came from the heart. I am not a PhD in ML / NLP, but it was always 
a dream. So getting accepted to this school without a PhD gives me immense pleasure to meet peers of the community.
