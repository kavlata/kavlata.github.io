## Notes from the book "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing" By Manning and Schutze

I thought of sharing my notes from this classical book of NLP. I really enjoy the examples, quotes and narration used in this book.
It takes you through the absolute basics of probability and linguistics, before entering into complex modelling for language.

### Preliminaries
1. Questions relevant to Linguistics
    * What kind of things do people say?
    * What do these things say/ask/request about world?
2. Lexical resources
    * Brown Corpus (American English)
    * Lancaster Oslo Bergen (British English)
    * Susanne Corpus (130000 subset of Brown)
    * Penn Treebank (Wall Street Journal articles)
    * Canadian Hansards (Canadian Parliament Proceedings - Bilingual Corpus)
    * Wordnet ( Dictionary, Hierarchy of synset of words, meronymy- part:whole relations)
3. Zipf law ( Principle of least effort )
    * f.r=k { f: frequency, r: rank (position in list), k:constant}
    * Number of meanings of word  m \alpha \sqrt{f}
4. Collocation
    * Phrasal verbs, compound nouns, idioms
    * frequent bigrams + particular pos pattern ( this has noise like "next year")
5. Concordance
    * KWIC - Keyword in Context 
    * Verb frames
