This is my interpretation of the paper "Recent trends in Deep learning based NLP". I have tried to represent the thoughts of this paper
in the form of a conceptmap. It definitely helps me to remember a paper when I see the concepts visually. Hope it helps. 
Thanks to the original authors for writing this paper.
